        <h1>Graduated discounts</h1>
        <br>

        <p>Business is not solely about making money. It's also about making our clients happy. What better
            way to make you happy than with additional discounts? In addition to our product discounts, we
            grant you further price reduction depending on the gross order value of your tailored order. You will
            receive discounts of 2% up to 10% in uniform gradations. This price reduction is independent of our
            discount campaigns and is granted when a particular gross-order value is reached or exceeded. This
            sale automatically applies to all items at the checkout point.</p>
