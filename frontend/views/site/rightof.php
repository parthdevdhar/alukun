        <h1>Right of withdrawal</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Are you having second thoughts regarding your purchase? We understand. Under particular
            conditions, you may have the right to withdraw from this contract within seven days without giving
            any reason. The cancellation period is seven days, starting from the date you and or a third party
            named by you has assumed ownership of the last items.
        </p>
        <p>To exercise your right for cancelation, you are urged to send an explicit declaration to us AluKun
            Ltd, Danziger Str. 3, 65428 RÃ¼sselsheim Am Main; e-mail: info@alukun.com (letter sent by post,
            fax or e-mail) of your reasons to cancel this contract.</p>
        <p>To meet the cancelation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your notification of exercising your
            right of withdrawal before the cancelation period has expired.
            Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts for
            delivering goods that are not prefabricated and manufactured as individual selection or tailored to
            the consumer's personal needs. In addition, clients ordering items under the KALE brand do not
            have a right to withdraw from the contract.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Consequences of cancellation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Suppose you decide to withdraw from this contract. In that case, we will return all payments that we
            have received from you (except additional costs associated with choosing a different type of
            delivery than the cheapest standard delivery offered by us have). The return of the sum will be
            within fourteen days starting from the date on which we received notification of your contract
            cancellation. For the repayment, AluKun will use the same payment method you have used for the
            original payment transaction unless something else was expressly agreed with you and our sales
            representative. In no circumstance will you be charged any fees for the agreed-upon repayment</p>
        <p>In the case of returning items, the client bears the direct costs of returning the goods. The prices are
            estimated at a minimum of around 45 euros.
            The deadline is granted if you register for the pick-up before the period of seven days has expired.
            As a client, you have to pay for a complete loss in value of the merchandise if this loss in value is
            due to handling the merchandise that is not necessary to check the goods' nature, properties, and
            functionality.</p>
