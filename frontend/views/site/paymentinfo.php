        <br>
        <p>When ordering via our online shop, a deposit of 100% of the gross amount of the order is due.
            Suppose client orders from one of the sales representatives in our showrooms, a deposit of 50% of
            the gross amount of the order are due. The remaining amount for the material must be transferred at
            the latest when the delivery is announced. After receipt of the deposit, we will arrange an
            appointment with you (if ordered) for the measurement and consultation. Suppose we cannot
            receive any incoming payment from your project. In that case, the delivery date will automatically
            be canceled by AluKun Ltd. New delivery date will take place between 7 to 21 working days. If you
            select "I will pay the entire amount" when ordering in one of our showrooms, you might be eligible
            to receive a 2% discount. The total amount must be paid by the date stated in the order
            confirmation. All goods remain AluKun property until the purchase price has been paid in full,
            including all ancillary claims.</p>
