        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Pricing</h1>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>There might be possibilities of data, including prices, inaccurately displayed on our site due to system or literal error. We prioritise every attempt to avoid these errors; however, they may occur sometimes. AluKun reserves the right to correct any errors when they occur, and we do not honour inaccurate or erroneous prices. Suppose a product&#39;s listed price is lower than its actual price. In that case, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping the product or cancel the order and, in turn, notify you of such cancellation. Finally, the order has shipped by AluKun. You may then agree to return the product or pay the remaining difference between the actual item price and charged prices. AluKun&#39;s prices are also subject to change without notification. We apologise for any nuisances as a result of this. In case you have any remaining questions, do not hesitate to contact us a<a href="mailto:info@alukun.com">t info@alukun.com </a>or 061316366781.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Applicable Law and Venue</h1>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The Federal Republic of Germany&#39;s law to exclude the UN sales law applies to contracts between the customer and us. The statutory provisions for restricting the choice of law and the applicability of mandatory requirements, particularly the state in which the customer (the person who completed the purchase) has his habitual residence, remain unaffected.</p>

        <p>Suppose the customer is a businessman, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law. In that case, the place of jurisdiction for all discourse arising from contractual agreements between customer and provider is the provider&#39;s registered office.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>The agreed-upon contract remains binding in its remaining parts even if individual points are legally ineffective. In place of the weak points, the statutory provisions apply, if they exist.</h1>
