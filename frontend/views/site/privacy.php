        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Legal framework</h1>

        <p>The term &quot;Cookie,&quot; whether referred to as a web cookie, internet cookie, browser cookie, or magic cookie, refers to a combination of data that a computer receives and then sends back without changing or altering it. These &quot;Cookies&quot; consist of information. This process takes place when the browser user visits a particular website. The visited website, in this case, &quot;AluKun,&quot; will automatically send cookies to your computer. Your computer, in turn, will store this information inside your web browser. &quot;AluKun&#39;s&quot; cookies do not seek to harm you in any way. AluKun&#39;s cookies seek to gather data on performance and functionality, social media, analytics, and advertising.</p>

        <p>Cookies are subject to the data protection regulations applicable in Germany, such as the Telemedia Act (TMG), the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), or the Telecommunications Act (TKG)</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY</h1>

        <p>We use this information for experience enrichment, analytics, and targeting advertising. We recommend allowing these functions to get the most out of your user experience.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>

        <p>These technologies are used to increase the performance and functionality of our AluKun website but are unnecessary to their use. However, it is predominant to note that without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>ANALYTICS</h1>

        <p>These technologies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our websites through third-party social networking and other websites.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>ADVERTISING</h1>

        <p>These technologies collect information used in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used and help us continuously improve our websites.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>PERSONAL DATA</h1>

        <p>Cookies retrieving your data, such as name the e-mail address, can be stored by AluKun. This is due to the registration profiles that can be made if so desired. Registration profiles are usually created when a client completes a purchase. This makes it easier to track your purchase status.</p>

        <p>In short, AluKun may only collect and use personal data for the provision of Telemedia insofar as the Telemedia Act (TMG) or another legal requirement that expressly relates to Telemedia allows it or the user has consented (&sect; 12 TMG).</p>

        <p>AluKun has further obligations to inform you as the user/client about the type, scope, and grounds of collecting and using personal data in a generally understandable form. The content of this information is available to you as the user at any time (Section 13 (1) TMG).</p>

        <p>As the user of this web page, you agree to the above content by electronically ticking the conditions box. When you, as the user of this website, tick the consent box, this process is then logged.</p>

        <p>As a user, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future (Section 13 (2) TMG).Consent means prior consent (cf. &sect; 183 BGB). When it comes to minors&#39; consent, the legal representative&#39;s consent is also meant here in case of doubt. In any case, consent must be given voluntarily.</p>
