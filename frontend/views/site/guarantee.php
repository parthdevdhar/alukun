        <h1>Guarantee</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            AluKun Ltd. grants a guarantee on the selected items two years on motor functions and five years
            on item profiles. The guarantee claim relates solely to defects that can be proven to be due to a
            material or manufacturing fault. This is a guarantee of quality. The warranty is spatially limited to
            using the object of purchase in the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Poland, and The
            Netherlands.
        </p>
        <p>Warranty services are only provided if the following requirements are met:</p>
        <p>The customer must be a consumer—a person who has made a purchase and agreed to the terms and
            conditions stipulated by AluKun Ltd. In the event of visible defects or defects in the functional test,
            these must be reported immediately within 48 hours of the delivery date at the latest.</p>
        <p>In the event of damage, the customer must immediately report the damage to the AluKun Ltd.
            Notification of the damage by telephone is not sufficient. The manufacturer reserves the statutory
            right to make improvements. Before other remedial measures are possible, three rectification
            attempts are permitted. The elimination of defects in the guarantee, e.g., through a repair or a
            replacement delivery, does not extend the original guarantee period. The warranty for defective
            parts, to which the manufacturer's warranty relates, will be repaired or replaced, if possible, by
            AluKun Ltd. The replacements will only be made against the return of the replaced parts, which
            become the property of AluKun Ltd. Defects subject to the warranty are remedied without any
            charge. If the guarantee and warranty are excluded, spare parts and assembly services are
            chargeable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Wear and blemishes such as wrinkles in the cloth are excluded from guarantee (under the non-defect
            catalog of the Bundesverband Kunststoff-und Schwergewebekonfektion e.V. Düsseldorf).
            Customary deviations in colour and design, weather-related colouring or crackling, and running
            noises caused by not regularly oiling or cleaning systems are not grounds for claiming a warranty.
            The guarantee also excludes defects caused by third-party components that do not come from
            AluKun Ltd., incorrect assembly, improper operation, or improper use of systems/pergolas under
            the following product list (e.g., during storms, snow, rain, etc.). Damage caused by filiform
            corrosion (growth of thread-like traces of corrosion under a layer of paint can occur under certain
            conditions of moisture and electrolyte content in the atmosphere, e.g., in coastal regions) or when
            using powder-coated aluminium parts is also excluded.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Expiration of the guarantee</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The guarantee expires if third-party spare parts are installed or after repairs that AluKun Ltd. or the
            manufacturer did not carry out.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Guarantee and legal warranty</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This manufacturer's guarantee applies in addition to the statutory or contractual warranty of AluKun
            Ltd.</p>
